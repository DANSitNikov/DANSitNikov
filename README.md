* JavaScript
* Figma/Avacode

### Besides this, I've used:
* Leaflet/Cartjs
* Webpack
* Phaser 3 
* GIT
* Team development

### My projects:
* HTML/CSS
  * [webdev](https://dansitnikov.github.io/webdev/webdev/) - static markup
  * [shelter](https://dansitnikov.github.io/shelter/shelter/pages/main/) - markup + JS (popup, pagination, slider)
*  JavaScript (ES6):
  * [momentum](https://dansitnikov.github.io/momentum/dist/) - copy of momentum in google (inspirational quotes, time, whether in your sity, background changes every hour)
  * [gem-puzzle](https://dansitnikov.github.io/gem-puzzle/dist/) - classic gem-puzzle game
